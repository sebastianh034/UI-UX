                We did not set out to create a technology instead we set out to solve a problem. Our history is in business operations, from sales to marketing, to client onboarding and retention. In each sector, we kept hearing business leaders preaching about scalability. As we researched what the market had to offer for scalability, there wasn't anything that delivered true duplication. Most solutions would automate a few tasks and then dump the bulk of the load back on the team.

                In response to this challenge companies simply hire more people. We knew there had to be a better way so we set out to create one. A solution that does all the follow-up in a successful way allowing your team to focus on what they do best.
